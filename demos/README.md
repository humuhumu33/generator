- NumPy >= 2.0.0
- The core GA implementation (`hologram_generator_mini.py`)

## Your Call to Action

**You have the power to transform your relationship with data.** Here's how to begin your journey:

1. **Start with Level 1** - Run `01_beginner/hello_world_demo.py` and feel the confidence of perfect results
2. **Progress through levels** - Each level builds your capabilities and expands your understanding
3. **Read the README** in each level directory to understand your new powers
4. **Try both versions** - Original and benchmark-compliant when available

**You're not just learning - you're becoming a data transformation expert.**
